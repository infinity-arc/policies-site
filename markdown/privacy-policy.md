## Web visitors

---

Like most website operators, Infinity Arc collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Infinity Arc's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Infinity Arc's visitors use its website. From time to time, Infinity Arc may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Infinity Arc also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://infinityarc.net blog posts. Infinity Arc only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Information Collection And Use

Certain visitors to Infinity Arc's websites choose to interact with Infinity Arc in ways that require Infinity Arc to gather personally-identifying information.

# Aggregated Statistics

## Google Analytics

---

Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, www.google.com (“Google Analytics” or “Google”). Google Analytics employs cookies that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there.

In using Google Analytics our website employs the extension “anonymizeIp”. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from EU/EEA member states. Google uses this information to analyze your use of our site, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to our website.

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this data on Google’s behalf. Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly as noted elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.

Google Analytics also offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation add-on offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage.

Google Analytics also uses electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used.

You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on referenced above at the following [link.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)

For the cases in which personal data is transferred to the US, Google has self-certified pursuant to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework).

## Children's Privacy

---

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## E-commerce

---

Those who engage in transactions with Infinity Arc – by purchasing Infinity Arc's services or products, are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Infinity Arc collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Infinity Arc. Infinity Arc does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Infinity Arc may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Infinity Arc's sole discretion. Infinity Arc encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
